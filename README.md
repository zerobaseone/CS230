# CS230
Portfolio Item for SNHU CS 230

The Gaming Room aims to transform its existing game for the Android platform, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based platform to expand its accessibility across multiple devices.  They wish to design a scalable system that allows for seamless gameplay with multiple teams and players, with unique team, game, and player IDs.

For this document, I performed a lot of research outside the scope of this class to fill out the various aspects of the design document, particularly the evaluation and recommendation sections.  Were I to revise a part, I would flesh out the recommendations further, particularly the operating system architectures and distributed systems and networks.

When I design software, I prefer to do a lot of research beforehand to determine the best approach to multiple factors, rather than start coding right away.  This analysis period ensures that I fully understand the clientâ€™s vision for their software and translate it into a technical plan.  Rather than making something that works on the surface level, I hope to come up with the most elegant solution that takes both the currect requirements and future scalability into account.
